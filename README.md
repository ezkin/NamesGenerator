# NamesGenerator - Inspired by Docker's NamesGenerator module.

This project provides Docker's random name generation feature to .NET applications.

You can download the NuGet package to use this feature. Please run this command to install the package into your project.

```
Install-Package NamesGenerator
```

I will gladly accept any kind of forks for migrating this project to Windows Phone, Windows 10 for Mobile, Mono, .NET Core, or Unity.
